      I love developing and desiging projects for the web.  
      Iâ€™ve spent the last  six years making sites and learning new technologies.  
      I take a modern, modular approach to code, and am thrilled with the current direction of the industry.
      Ruby on Rails is my go to web technology, but I love Wordpress for quick sites and am eager to get into React more and more.
