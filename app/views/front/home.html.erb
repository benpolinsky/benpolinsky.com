        <p>
          The idea is simple: pick between two pieces of art
          Not just a painting versus painting, but any 'work of art' 
          against any other. Finally: The Little Prince vs. Pulp Fiction.
          At last: The Simpsons vs. War & Peace.  You get the idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Art vs. Art's API is built using Ruby on Rails with a front-end developed in React.  A mobile version is planned using React Native.

      <h2>Ruby on Rails</h2>
      <p>I've been working with Ruby on Rails since late 2011.  At the time, I was doing front end work and using Wordpress as my main platform for developing.</p>
      <p>Rails was my introduction to application development, from testing and version control, to automated deployments, NOSQL databases, and everything else under the sun that goes into <%= link_to "web application development", 'http://s3.amazonaws.com/maptini.com/app/public/system/images/38573/original/52D6FC49-085A-47F8-8E1B-83740ABBD807.png?1333665118' %>.</p>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <p>So many JavaScript frameworks, which to choose?  I've settled on React.js for now, but vue.js is certainly appealing.  "The Langauge of the Web" is becoming much more as technologies like React Native allow us to write mobile apps in JS.</p>

      <h2>Wordpress</h2>
      <p>Wordpress is a great platform to develop on and continues to mature.</p>
      <p>Many people are familiar with its admin interface, which makes it a great choice as a backend for many projects.  Asides from Wordpress' extensive plugin environment, The Bedrock framework, Twig templating, and other methods for separating logic from presentation and markup are all great developments.</p>
